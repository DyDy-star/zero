问题内容:
Odysseus was presented with a system of equations by the goddesses Calypso, Circe, and Daphne. The system is represented by a triangle whose vertices correspond to three of these goddesses. Mr. Odysseus, an expert in algebra, knows that the total sum of the angles in the triangle should equal 180 degrees. 

How long would it take Mr. Odysseus to solve the system if performing only the four arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) as well as solving linear equations are allowed? Note that he is not allowed to use trigonometric functions.

The problem asks: What is the smallest number of operations Odysseus must perform to solve the system, if he chooses the fastest route?
Note that each operation must be performed sequentially.

Tom believes he is a typist. He claims that every time he tries to type any word in a dictionary, only the correct spelling appears. However, when Tom writes his own name on a piece of paper, he invariably spells it "TOM". Can you prove that the probability of him typing his own name is infinitesimal?

Aaron's solution was to transform the rat problem into a more accessible form. The complicated term for simplifying the "limit" $n\to \infty$ results in a situation where all terms from the original solution disappear except for the constant term.

Therefore, the simplified polynomial for the number of ways to arrange N minitauers on an MxM board looks like this:

\[ \frac{(M-2N+N+2)!}{(M-2N)!N!(N+2)!} \]

The problem of finding the perfect password to see the correct proof is actually finding \( N + 2 \), since Aaron considered it as a security feature to protect this highly valuable information.

Mr. Chong eventually discovered the simplicity behind Aaron's solution, and after a close examination of the algebraic factors, he found that the expression indeed simplifies to the few remainin

. Problem posing is an expertise, it's a meta-skill. You are asked for an actual problem, since through characteristic generality your problem-posing skill is transparent in your puzzle-solving skill. There is too much overlap between the skills in a ~20k limit setting, and clearly this is a field you can't write new content without verifiability assurance (or a higher limit on another platform).  Ask tons of people how you should pose a matchstick magic square, and their ideas will be new and potentially fruitful but not in the long term if they don't all sound phenomenally crazy a priori - but then, what would you be discussing about because there is no real discussion?

问题内容:
A very large, invisible, spinning tube is bisected by a plane that passes through one of its far ends and is parallel to the axis of rotation of the tube. One side of the plane consists of a long stretched line which follows the circle where this tube and its axis meet. Given that only points on this line between the base of the tube and its endpoint are given as $P_{0}, P_{1}, \ldots, P_{n}, n > 6$, suppose a particle starts to travel on the tube from the endpoint $P_{n}$, coming close to every infinitely many circle.

Determine, with proof, the minimum of the integer sequence $_{ 4 n + 3 } P_{ 2 m }$.

\textbf{Eleventy-ninth Problem Competition in Penquintland}
The Problem Committee of the Eleventy-ninth Problem Competition in Penquintland would like to give away the Pale Awards (also known as prizemoney) to the winners. The prize money is a convex hexahedron whose faces have only integer areas, sides have integer lengths, and all interior angles are right angles. Use as few Pythagorean triples as possible to find the dimensions of the hexahedron and calculate the total prize money owed.

What is the minimum number of Pythagorean triples that are strictly sufficient for the construction of a prize hexahedron?

You have taken over a former competitor's farm, specializing in producing a unique type of rabbits with distinctive branding and traits that add to their value in the market. The farm's population has seen exponential growth historically, but upon your takeover, a former employee expressed interest in selling a portion of the farm under the condition that you would handle the remaining rabbits. Here are two pieces of information you provided:

1. Prior to the transition, the farm's performance was tracked in terms of incoming and outgoing rabbits.
2. All rabbits born on your farm retain their brand, while rabbits that leave and then return do not.

The total rabbit population on your farm has grown exponentially over time, implying that the number of rabbits increases significantly as they

Farmer John's farm consists of N barren plots of land. He wants to irrigate M kernels of corn that lie on one or more plots of land, and he has Q water spigots he can install near some or all of the plots. Spigots can be installed both inside the plots and outside them, at coordinates (x, y). Additionally, he can connect each plot with as many spigots as he wants, creating arcs between them (it's possible that a spigot is connected to a plot multiple times). However, he needs to avoid installing two spigots with the same y-coordinate. Determine the minimum number of Q water spigots that must be installed so that irrigation can always be provided for at least one kernel of corn.

A cyclic n-sided polygon is drawn in the interior of a circle such that its sides (lines) divide the interior into n sectors. The inscribed rectangles are formed with each vertex in a subsequent sector, and each rectangle shares an edge with the circle. The inscribed rectangles are arranged in a clockwise direction. If n = 6, the rectangles overlap with their immediate neighbors in 5 of the n/2 sectors (assuming rectangle arrangements are the same starting from either left or right). So the total number of sectors covered by both sets of rectangles in this case is (n/2)*5 = 15.

First, consider rolling a number on a standard 10-sided die. Then, multiply the number you get by 3, and consider this as the number after applying the equivalent noise-to-signal operation. Apply this refined version to two different initial numbers, such as 1 and 5. Think about the percentage of resulting outputs in each case. Then, perform the operation with an input of $100$, rounding the result down to the nearest whole number. What fraction of the outputs will you get?

This leads to <b>314</b> hilarious responses. Let's recap and derive a result. Consider the random input ($x_0$). Operate

Let's say you have 7 pointy pyramids, each consisting of a ball at the apex, and their base is on a circle. Each vertex of the circle is the apex of three such pyramids, with their sides forming the same shape. What is the maximum number of pyramids that can be placed in this manner such that no more than 2 pyramids share an edge?

In the plane, given a set of points and circles, a "circular trek" is a closed path which passes through all the points and all the circles such that each circle is the only one that contains the path between the two circular arc segments adjacent to it. Prove that the number of distinct circular treks is at most 10^{10} given there are at most 500 points and 500 circles in the set of points and circles.

A landlord has a row of apartments. He charges $x$ dollars monthly for renting one apartment. It is known that the number of apartments he rents (each being 1 or 2) and the amount of money he earns form a second-degree polynomial. If he rents all the apartments, he earns $1024. Determine the number of $2-apartment houses he owns.

问题内容:
Alice and Bob each have a spiral of numbers. For Alice, the spiral starts at 1 and the spiral head moves clockwise around the spiral in increasing order until every square is numbered.

The pattern continues until there is no space left to add more numbers, but the spiral maintains its spiral shape.
At each step, the next available number in the spiral head (if that number is not already in its correct position within the spiral) moves clockwise around the outer layer until it reaches a space. If the destination is not yet filled, the number moves clockwise inward; if the destination is correctly filled, the number stays in its current spot.

Bob's spiral starts at the center instead, with the spiral head moving counter-clockwise around the spiral in increasing order until every square is
